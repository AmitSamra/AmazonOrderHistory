Amazon.com is the largest online retailer in the world. One of the best things about Amazon is the ability to download order reports in CSV format. In this project, I provide insight into my Amazon order history spanning 2008 to 2019, inclusive. I use pandas, matplotlib and sqlalchemy to clean, analyze and persist data. 

This repository includes a [JupyterNotebook](https://github.com/AmitSamra/AmazonOrderHistory/blob/master/AmazonOrderHistory.ipynb), which contains all of the code used to generate the following report. 

# Data Processing

The following is a the raw dataframe generated by reading [amazon_purchases.csv](https://github.com/AmitSamra/AmazonOrderHistory/blob/master/amazon_purchases.csv) into Python Pandas. Note how columns are formatted incorrectly and many fields are missing.

Data cleaning is an important part of the ETL process. The following shows the final dataframe. Note how the formatting and NaN have been removed.
