Amazon.com is the largest online retailer in the world. One of the best things about Amazon is the ability to download order reports in CSV format. In this project, I provide insight into my Amazon order history spanning 2008 to 2019, inclusive. I use pandas, matplotlib and sqlalchemy to clean, analyze and persist data. 

This repository includes a [JupyterNotebook](https://github.com/AmitSamra/AmazonOrderHistory/blob/master/AmazonOrderHistory.ipynb), which contains all of the code used to generate the following report. 

# Data Processing

The following is a the raw dataframe generated by reading [amazon_purchases.csv](https://github.com/AmitSamra/AmazonOrderHistory/blob/master/amazon_purchases.csv) into Python Pandas. Note how columns are formatted incorrectly and many fields are missing.

Data cleaning is an important part of the ETL process. The following shows the final dataframe. Note how the formatting and rows containing NaN have been replaced or removed.

# Data Analysis

Let's begin with a striking number: $30,000. That's how much I spent on Amazon over the last 12 years. 

![Total Spending](https://github.com/AmitSamra/AmazonOrderHistory/blob/master/img/total_spent.png)

It took 781 transactions to achieve this number. 2019 marked a sharp increase in my transactions, surpassing the peak I hit in 2011. 

![TransactionsByYear](https://github.com/AmitSamra/AmazonOrderHistory/blob/master/img/TransactionsByYear.png)

The following shows my daily purchase totals. Most of my transactions seem to be below $50 with occasional big-ticket purchases. 

![DailyPurchaseAmount](https://github.com/AmitSamra/AmazonOrderHistory/blob/master/img/DailyPurchaseAmount.png)

My average transaction size was almost $40.

![AveragePerTransPerYear](https://github.com/AmitSamra/AmazonOrderHistory/blob/master/img/AveragePerTransPerYear.png)

This graph shows what seems to be an outlier. I spent over $7,000 in 2011. 

![PurchasesByYear](https://github.com/AmitSamra/AmazonOrderHistory/blob/master/img/PurchasesByYear.png)

It seems I spend the most amount in March, July and August and not during Christmas. 

![PurchasesByMonth](https://github.com/AmitSamra/AmazonOrderHistory/blob/master/img/PurchasesByMonth.png)

Is there any particular day that I purchase more frequently? Yes, Monday. I seem to order more in the beginning of the week, likely due to the chances of things being delivered quickly. 

![PurchasesByDay](https://github.com/AmitSamra/AmazonOrderHistory/blob/master/img/PurchasesByDay.png)

Most of my purchases on Amazon are for Computers and Electronics equipment. The two categories account for nearly 50% of my Amzon purchases.

![PurchasesByCategoryShare](https://github.com/AmitSamra/AmazonOrderHistory/blob/master/img/PurchasesByCategoryShare.png)

Almost 60% of my transaction are with Amazon as the seller.

But Amazon accounts for 75% of my purchase spend. Perhaps it's the generous returns policy for goods sold directly by Amazon.
